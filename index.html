                    An anthology of stories by the main
                    Chinese science fiction writer Liu Cixin. The texts included in the collection were written from
                    1999 to 2017 - it turns out to be a kind of review of 18 years of writing. From this angle, one can
                    trace not only the evolution of the author, but also the development of Cixin’s key idea - the
                    relationship of the small and insignificant (or only seemingly so) with the grandiose and eternal.

                    Cixin is inspired by the best examples of classical fiction - books by Arthur C. Clarke, Philip K.
                    Dick, Isaac Asimov, Frank Herbert - gracefully interweaving oriental flavor and her thoughts on how
                    progress will change a person individually and society as a whole.
